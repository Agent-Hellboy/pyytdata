# GitHub Action Workflow enforcing our code style.

# Trigger the workflow on both push (to the main repository, on the main branch)
# and pull requests (against the main repository, but from any repo, from any branch).

    branches:

  pull_request:
# Brand new concurrency setting! This ensures that not more than one run can be triggered for the same commit.
# It is useful for pull requests coming from the main repository since both triggers will match.
